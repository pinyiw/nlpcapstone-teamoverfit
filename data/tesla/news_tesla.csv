That's according toÂ <a href=""https://www.patriarchpartners.com/"" target=""_blank"">Patriarch Partners</a> founder Lynn Tilton, one of the most recognizable females on Wall Street.</p> <p>Most business news TV watchers know Tilton for her impeccable wardrobe and confident-sounding voice. But what has gotten lost in the pursuit of sound-bites through the years is the story that took Tilton from a nationally-ranked high school tennis player to Morgan Stanley   /Goldman Sachs   to buying and fixing distressed companies to fighting off the SEC.</p> <p><strong>TheStreet: </strong>'When you go into these distressed companies, how do you turn them around?&quot;</p> <p><strong>Lynn Tilton:</strong> &quot;You have to look at your environment... but, most important, as I said, my main focus these days is on product and innovation. Because it used to be that restructuring a broken company was really all about the expenses and the liability side of a balance sheet...</p> <p>And I used to say you have to put five fingers where the blood is flowing and drive the future with the palm of your other hand because if you just stop the blood, by the time you were finished you were drowning, because you hadn't innovated.</p> <p>But never before today is innovation more important. Because, the trajectory of change is acceleratedÂ  exponentially.</p> <p>So, for me, the most important thing is dreaming the future... In the end, most companies become distressed because their revenues fall.. their products are not competitive. And if i can't leapfrog where others are today, then I can't take this company into the future.</p> <p>Â ..Our job is to create propensity or growth and that formula is people x plan x process x pace. That means you need the right people in the right places, nothing can replace that...Â </p> <p>...When I close my eyes and dream the future, what does this company look like?Â Â </p> <p>But, the innovation revolution is what will be the biggest challenge as we have continued disruptors taking market share and changing how we do business you have to see it very quickly where it is going and jump on the band wagon</p> <p>i mean five years ago i bought a Tesla   Â and moved it into the showroom and took it apart piece by piece and I made a decision at that moment that I believed the autonomous car was going to be the future.</p> <p>I started moving our products towards that at my automotive company.</p> <p>And today our biggest products are battery trades and the future of infotainment and advanced driving. So, you have to take bets and you've got to see trends, especially if you are not going to be the major disruptor in an industry.&quot;</p> <p><strong>TheStreet:</strong> &quot;Lynn, you took apart a Tesla?&quot;</p> <p><strong>Lynn Tilton:</strong> &quot;Yeah, I mean, I learned my businesses bottom up. Every business I run I have to learn part by part, piece by piece otherwise I can't dream the future.</p> <p>So, you know I can take a helicopter apart too. but, that's the way I had to learn what the pieces were and where i thought things were going to drive the strategy for that company.&quot;Â </p> <h3>Follow us onÂ <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/THESTREETLIVE"" target=""_blank"">SoundCloud</a></h3> <iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/415174317&color=%233f5683&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"" width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>"

TSLA,2017-11-20 15:00:00 +0000,"Investing.com - Last Thursday, Elon Musk unveiled the much-hyped Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Semi truck, as well as a new Roadster.The truck comes with Enhanced Autopilot, can travel 500 miles between charges, haul 80,000 pounds, and has a special design that makes jackknifing impossible. It also reportedly has faster acceleration and better uphill performance than diesel-powered trucks.The new roadster has three motors, a 620-mile range, and can go from zero to 100 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds. But before investors jump on the Tesla bandwagon, they should pause to consider a few things. First, Musk said production of the truck and Roadster would begin in 2019 and 2020 respectively, still a ways away. Second, Tesla already faces competition in the electric truck market, as Cummins (NYSE:CMI) and Daimler have already announced fully-electric models. Finally, the electric truck and new sports car might serve as a distraction, but remember: when it comes to delivering their Model 3 sedan, the company has been in self-described production hell.Tesla has yet to be profitable and investors should want to see more than shiny new prototypes before really getting excited."

TSLA,2017-10-23 14:40:00 +0000,"Investing.com - Several weeks ago, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said that the Model 3 sedan was â€œdeep in production hell.â€ù That clearly seems to be the case. Tesla has more than 400,000 orders for the Model 3 sedan, but so far, only 220 cars have been delivered, a far cry from the 1,500 Model 3 vehicles Tesla said they would deliver in the third quarter. As a result, JP Morgan slashed their delivery forecast on Friday for Tesla Model 3â€™s in the next quarter by 50%, from 30,000 to 15,000 vehicles.Interestingly, just as Tesla would want to ramp up production, they reportedly fired hundreds of workers. Many of the jobs were in sales and administration, but the layoffs also hit the factory floor. Teslaâ€™s Model 3 was hailed as the first mass-market electric vehicle. But big manufacturing delays would take away the companyâ€™s first-to-market advantage. There are also concerns that the production bottleneck could be tied to Tesla underestimating production costs. Such sentiments were echoed by Ryan Brinkman, an automotive equity research analyst at JP Morgan, who wrote in a note to clients that â€œif the vehicle proves structurally more expensive to manufactureâ€_Tesla may need to increase the price of the vehicle to consumers, with negative implications for demand.â€ùItâ€™s probably too early to panic, but keep a close eye on Tesla when they report Q3 earnings on November 1st."

Well, Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi and Daniel Chen contend that ""Tesla's Q2 production and deliveries report raised more questions than answers, particularly about Model S and X demand."" They explain why: Uncharacteristically, Tesla did not provide in-transit vehicle sales, but based on commentary in the press release, we suspect that Tesla's owned inventory increased materially for the 3rd straight quarter and may now be over 13,000 units, or ~7 weeks, or perhaps 45 cars per sales and service outlet.  While the inventory build may be prudent and desirable for sales and services purposes, we do note that inventory appears to have more than doubled over the last three quarters, while sales have been flat and customer deposits (a good proxy for customer orders) have declined... In addition to Tesla not providing a vehicle in transit figure, the company's delivery report raised several other questions: (1) Why did Tesla put out the release after the market close on the eve of a holiday?"
